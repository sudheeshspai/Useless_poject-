### Project Description

There are 10 levels after all the levels it will show wasted your time successfully  and  a dance of Steve at last with Rick-Roll sound effect. After every levels there would be a sound effect of mario's death and for non mincraft palyers I will explain what is the relationship between Steve and bed when it starts to get night steve wants to go to bed due to evils arise at night(he is [not like us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H58vbez_m4E) he sleaps when he want to sleep) so he want to reach as soon as posible and go to bed bed.
