### Project Description

### Made a funny maze game with Steve and Bed he wants to reach the bed. There are 10 levels with different mazes and with many exciting things ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞). After every level there would be a sound effect of mario's death and for non-mincraft players I will explain what is the relationship between Steve and bed when it starts to get night Steve wants to go to bed due to evils arising at night(he is [not like us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H58vbez_m4E) he sleeps when he want to sleep) so he wants to reach as soon as possible and go to bed.
